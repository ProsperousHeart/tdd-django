# About Tests

By default, pytest will autodiscover test files that start or end with `test` -- e.g., `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`. Test functions must begin with `test_`, and if you want to use classes they must also begin with `Test`.

If this is your first time with pytest be sure to review the [Installation and Getting Started](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html) guide as well as [Pytest for Beginners](https://testdriven.io/blog/pytest-for-beginners/).
